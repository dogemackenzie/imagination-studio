"""Work on a clip you already have: restyle it, extend it, or fix one region of it. Three Library actions.

    Restyle   three steps. The clip's first frame is redrawn by the picture model in the look the prompt describes
              (an `edit` job), the clip's motion is read by Motion Previs (its depth layer), then the clip is made again
              (MiniMax H3 Ref2VA) from the depth layer as <Video 1> and the redrawn frame as <Picture 1>.
    Extend    a new clip that opens on the clip's last frame, then (by default) the two joined into one file:
              renders/<job>-extended.mp4. Over 15 seconds the new part is a long take, a chain of clips.
    Fix       the same three steps as Restyle, with an instruction for the first frame in place of a look.

Restyle and Fix go the way the create wizard goes for a control layer (server.motion_template): the source clip
itself as a reference video is followed so closely that the clip comes back unchanged (measured: a new look and an
edited first frame were both ignored), while a depth map of it carries only the structure, motion and camera, and
the look and the setting come from the first-frame picture. The whole frame is redrawn, so small details can change.

Each is queued through the studio's own jobs (``video``, ``long`` and ``edit``) and the Motion Previs analysis queue
(motion.py), so the queues, the Sparks, the QA gate and the Library treat the results like any other. A step that
follows another (Extend's join, the analysis after the frame, the clip after the analysis) is started by ``then``,
which server.perform calls when the job whose ``params.then`` names a chain here has finished; an analysis is
followed by a thread of its own. The chains live in memory, like the jobs. The pack of a clip is kept and used again
(motion/revise.json) while the clip is unchanged.
